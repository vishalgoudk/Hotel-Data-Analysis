# Hotel-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview

This hotel data analysis project involves leveraging SQL Server for querying and analyzing hotel data sourced from an Excel file. The project encompasses the creation of a database, querying data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating data visualizations using Power BI.

# Tools Used

    SQL Server: Primary database management system for data storage and querying.
    Excel File: Source of raw hotel data.
    Power BI: Business intelligence tool for creating interactive visualizations.

# Project Steps

1. Database Creation

The first step involves creating a database to store the hotel data. The database is designed to accommodate various tables that represent different aspects of hotel operations, such as reservations, revenue, and amenities.

2. Querying Data

Data is queried from the created tables, involving fetching information from multiple tables and combining the data to derive meaningful insights. SQL queries are employed to retrieve relevant data for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to gain insights into the hotel data. Key questions are addressed, including:

    Is our hotel revenue growing yearly?
    Should we increase our parking lot size?
    What trends can we see in the data?

These questions are explored using SQL queries and analytical techniques to uncover patterns and make informed decisions.

4. Data Visualizations Using Power BI

To enhance data interpretation and presentation, Power BI is utilized to create interactive visualizations. These visualizations may include charts, graphs, and dashboards that provide a comprehensive view of the hotel data. The goal is to convey key findings in a visually appealing and understandable manner.

# Conclusion

The hotel data analysis project aims to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making within the hotel management. By utilizing SQL Server for data querying and Power BI for visualization, the project enables a holistic analysis of hotel operations, revenue trends, and potential areas for improvement. The combination of SQL and Power BI facilitates a seamless transition from raw data to actionable insights, empowering hotel management to make informed decisions for the improvement and growth of the business.
